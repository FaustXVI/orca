After a reboot, the vault will be in sealed status.

In order to unseal the vault, you will need to gather enough participants that have an unseal key share to reach the minimum quorum.

On the *ephemeral vault*, run the command below and insert each `team member`'s hardware tokens one after the other when instructed to:
<table width=100% style="border:2px solid red;"><td style="padding:0;">

```
unseal
```
