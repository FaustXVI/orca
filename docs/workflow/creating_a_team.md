Initially, one person should take care of organising an official ceremony to manipulate the offline vault.
This person is called the `organiser` (ðŸ“¢).

To perform the actual work on the vault system, the organiser will need to gather a team of at least 2 tech-savy people.
These people are called the `team members` (ðŸ‘¥), the ðŸ“¢`organiser` can be one of them.
These people will perform preparative work *before* the ceremony and they will be present *during* the ceremony.
