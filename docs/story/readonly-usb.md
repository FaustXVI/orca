# All USB keys are not created equals

"What if someone overwrite the key while verifiying it ?", asked Jules.

"Your creativity scares me sometimes", said Shuri, "but that seems doable indeed."

"We could avoid the issue with a USB key with a hardware readonly switch", started Leiko, "When we verify the USB key, we switch it to readonly, and we switch it back to read/write when booting on it."

"Good idea", said Adira, "but then we should boot on the same computer that verified the key."

"Why so ?", asked Jules.

"Because otherwise someone could switch the key between the verification and the boot.", answered Adira.

"True.", said Jules, "but then we don't need an always offline computer, we could use any computer. We can configure the NixOS on the key to disable all network interface so that we are sure it's offline."

"Indeed.", remarked Adira, "and that will simplify things at the same time."

Five years later, Shuri comes to Jules house.

"I had no choice Jules, I am sorry.", she said.

"Sorry about what ?", asked Jules.

"I stole the root CA for Evil Corp.", started Shuri, "They came to my home a year ago and told me to steal it or face the concequences. I created a corrupted key with a keylogger and a fake binary on my computer to verify it that actually did nothing. Then I volonteered to verify it."

"You can stop there Shuri", interupted Jules, "I understand. You have nothing to be sorry about, you did what you have to do. Now, the important thing is to take care of you."

Shuri wanted to continue to talk though, and Jules listened. She felt releive to finally express the rage, fear and sadness she was keeping for herself since a year.

Late that night, Jules went back in time. Protecting his friends from harm will always be a good reason to tickle the spacetime continuum.
