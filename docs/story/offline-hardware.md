# Offline hardware

It is decided that a dedicated computer that will never see the network will be used  to access the Root CA.
Jules will keep it in his safe.
Jules goes on holyday for a month to the himalayas and decides to go full offline.
Soon after he left, the online CA gets too old an can not create certificates.
The production is stopped until he comes back.
The company is not dead but won't survive this again.
It is decided to verify the usability of the online CA at least once a year.
