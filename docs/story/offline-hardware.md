# Offline hardware

After reading his future self sent him, Jules sets up a meeting to discuss more with Adira and Shuri.
He still have to keep his promess to his dad and never mention their family's time machine.

"I think using my own coputer may be a mistake. I'll use it every day and I am not infaillible. One day I may make a mistake and open a breach for a remote attack", he said.

"That's a good point.", answered Adira, "what about having a dedicated computer for the root CA ?"

"That's a good idea, and we could make that computer completly offline to avoid any remote attack.", added Shuri.

"And I'll keep that computer in a safe to make sure it doesn't see any network cable even when I am not looking.", concluded Jules.

They agreed one that plan and created the company that way, which, once again, had a big success.

After two years of non-stop work, Jules decided it was time for well-deserved vacations.
He decided to make his life-long dream come true and went to the himalayas where he had a spiritual retreat away from any high-tech object.
Overall, his trip lasted for two months.

When he arrived back at his home, Vernes was there, waiting for him.

"I hope you rested well because you are expected at work right now !", said Vernes.

"What's happenning ?", asked Jules.

"One month after you left, the Intermediate CA got expired. We stopped production since a month.", answered Vernes.

"Great Scott !", yelled Jules.

"That's fine, we'll survive this but it better not happen again !", said Vernes.

"We'll setup a yearly check to make sure that the intermediate CA will continue working for at least one more year.", offered Jules.

"Sounds good to me.", said Vernes.

One our later, Jules was at work, signing the ne Intermediate CA. The next day, production started again. 6 mounth later, everything was back on tracks.
