# Offline hardware

After reading what his future self had sent him, Jules set up a meeting to discuss more with Adira and Shuri.
He still had to keep his promess to his dad and never mention their family's time machine.

"I think using my own computer may be a mistake. I'll use it every day and I am not infaillible. One day I may make a mistake and open a breach for a remote attack", he said.

"That's a good point" Adira replied, "what about having a dedicated computer for the root CA ?"

"That's a good idea, and we could make that computer completly offline to avoid any remote attack" Shuri added.

"And I'll keep that computer in a safe to make sure it doesn't see any network cable even when I am not looking" Jules concluded.

They agreed on that plan and created the company that way, which, once again, had a big success.

After two years of non-stop work, Jules decided it was time for well-deserved vacations.
He decided to make his life-long dream come true and went to the Himalayas where he had a spiritual retreat away from any high-tech object.
Overall, his trip lasted for two months.

When he arrived back at his home, Vernes was there, waiting for him.

"I hope you rested well because you are expected at work right now !" Verne said.

"What's happenning ?" Jules asked.

"One month after you left, the Intermediate CA got expired. We stopped production since a month." Vernes replied.

"Great Scott !" Jules yelled.

"That's fine, we'll survive this but it'd better not happen again !" Vernes said.

"We'll setup a yearly check to make sure that the intermediate CA will continue working for at least one more year." Jules offered.

"Sounds good to me." Vernes said.

One hour later, Jules was at work, signing the new Intermediate CA. The next day, production started again. 6 months later, everything was back on tracks.
