# Avoiding the single point of failure

"That's not enough!" said Shuri.

"What do you mean?" Jules asked.

"The yearly check is a good idea and we should keep it, but it's not enough", Shuri answered, "What if anything happens to you ? We tried everything to get access to the root CA when you weren't there. Thanks to a locksmith and Vernes, we could open the safe as you saw. We even guessed your session password!"

"And we'll need to talk about the *a* later by the way", quickly said Adira to Jules, half smiling.

"But we couldn't get the root CA password!" Shuri added.

"Since you created its password thanks to your password manager to which you setup a password we couldn't guess" Adira concluded.

"Isn't it good news?" Jules started, "It means the root CA was safe isn't it?"

"The good news is that you came back!" Shuri replied, "What if something happens to you?"

"That's not a plaisant thought." Jules said, "But it worth asking the question."

"I am afraid the only solution is to give access to the CA to someone else than you" Shuri stated.

"I agree" Jules said, "I would trust Vernes with my life but he doesn't have the technical knowledge necessary to work with the CA."

He paused, thinking.

"I trust all of you though. I'll give access to you both. I'll share the necessary passwords via our password manager." he concluded.

"Seems good to me" Adira said, "But please change them all for generated passwords!"

Six months later, Adira went to Jules home, crying. Fresh wounds were visible all over her body.

"I am sorry Jules" they said.

"What happenned Adira? Are you okay?" asked Jules.

"No, I am not!" Adira sobbed, "Some people came to my house and threatened me. They made me steal the root CA."

"I am so sorry Adira. You did the right thing. Your safety is worth more than any company, including  ours" Jules said, calmly. He then stopped talking and gave Adira a reconforting hug.

After a few minutes and a lot of tears, Jules said: "Now, let's get you some help, physically and emotionnally."

Once Jules made sure that Adira was safe, he decided to go see his dad again. The issue was not his company anymore, it was about his friend.

After a quick conversation, Jules went two years back in time, before the production even started, and wrote himself an email.
