# The big idea

Jules Brown woke up with a solution to his problem.
Finally, after two decades of searching!
He ran to his brother's house and started to pitch his idea.

"Did you ever wonder about the quality of the water you use to cook?
What about the quality of the food you cook?
What if you had a smart strainer that would analyze the water going through it and give you all the relevent data?
Are your pasta really gluten-free?
Is your water contaminated with heavy metals?
Are you eating too much carbs?
All your questions answered in one app."

"Interesting idea" Vernes said. "If you want to move forward with it, you'll need a catchy name and some investment".

"I don't have a good name yet, but for the investment, I don't want to share this new market with anyone I don't trust a hundred percent. I am pretty sure I can bring half of it so I only need one person that can bring as much as me on the table."

"I see where you are going with this. Give me a week to think about it. Meanwhile, find a good name."

A week later, the two brothers met at Lou's cafe.
Vernes went right to the point.

"You understand that if we do this and fail, it's the whole family that is going bankrupt?"

"Yes, I know. That's why we'll have quality and security as our core values."

"Ok, then we do fifty-fifty. I'll be the CEO and you'll be the CTO."

"Agree, you'd be a better face for the company than I would. And I still need to solve the technical challenges that comes with the idea. I am still strugling with a name though."

"What about Hole-in-one?"

"That's... creative..."

"The way I see it, if you're gonna go bankrupt building a company, why not do it with some style?"

"That's a dad joke!"

"Yes, and I love it! Don't judge me! Now, if we agree with the name, let's build a company!"

"Let's! First thing first, we should hire the perfect team."
