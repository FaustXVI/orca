# Meet the team

Jules and Vernes decided to start buy hirering a research and development team.
After a month of interviews, they decided to hire three people :

Leiko, the hardware expert.
Her ability to fix things with close to nothing and solve complex problems at the speed of thoughts quickly earned her the nickname of "Go Go".
She'll be in charge of the design of the product up to the electronics.
Once the actuators are setup, software will take care of the rest.

Shuri, the developer.
She is the bridge between the physical world and the dream word.
She is a senior developer able to improve any feature while coding it.
Once her work is done, only two things are left : making computers up and running what she did and, of course massively produce the Hole-in-one first product !

Adira, the admin.
Adira will be perfect to keep the Hole-in-one's ship flying !
They are well versed in computer administration and complement it brillantly with their coding skills.
They will ensure that every known security issue is taken into account.
