# Raise the bar

At this security meeting, Jules requested everyone. Vernes was concerned as this never happened before. He decided to go see his brother few minutes before the offical meeting.

"What's happenning Jules ? Why do you need me ?", asked Vernes.

"One of us will get physically attacked. We have to find a solution", started Jules.

"Or stop the whole thing all together", completed Vernes, "I get it. You have my full support."

"Thanks Vernes", said Jules.

5 minutes later, the meeting starts.

"I want us to reconsider the risks for our root CA", started Jules, "Especially, I want us to consider that one of us could get physically threaten to steal it."

Everybody stayed silent for a few seconds, shocked by the request.

"First of all", start Vernes, "Let me be clear. If anything like this ever happens, please do not do anything stupid ! Nothing is worth risking your life and this company is no exception ! That"s true for Jules and myself too. Don't even think twice. Do what you are told to do and be safe."

The atmosphere is heavy, nobody expected that.
Not a word was said for the next two minutes.

Then Jules added, "Another way to think of the same problem : imagine that someone successfully corrupted me. Consider me as the attacker."

"And why don't we consider that we are all corrupted ? Or at least more than one of us.", asked Leiko.

"That's a good point. However, we cannot protect ourself against an opponent with an overwhelming amount of resources like a state. Let's start with one bad agent, if we find a way to scale things then all the better, but it shouldn't be the goal. We have to stop somewhere.", answered Jules.

"Let's all take the rest of the day to thing about it calmly.", said Vernes, "Then, starting tomorrow, please concider this when thinking of the security of our root CA."

"Thanks everyone", concluded Jules.
