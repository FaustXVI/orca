# Need backup !

They decide to do a backup of the root CA after each change.
Since they are using Vault, it is cyphered and safe to keep online (otherwise, the whole internet is in danger).
Few years later, they realise that the offline root CA has been stolen again.
Adira admits they had been threaten and installed a keylogger on the offline computer to get enough shares.
Jules go back in time.
