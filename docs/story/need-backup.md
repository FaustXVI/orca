# Need backup!

"What if anything happens to the offline computer?" Jules asked, onpening a new meeting.

"That's a good point!" Adira said, "We need to backup the offline root CA!"

"But all our backups are online spreaded in different places. Aren't they Adira?" Leiko asked.

"Indeed, they are." Adira replied.

"I don't think that's an issue." said Shuri, "since we are using a vault, the whole databased is encrypted with the password that we each have a share of. It cannot be read without a quorum. The real thing to protect and that should stay offline is the secret key."

"I agree" Adira said, "If we never reach a quorum on an online computer, then the key will not leak and we can save the database online."

"How safe is that encryption?" Jules asked.

"It uses an algorithm that is recommended to secure communications over internet." Shuri replied, "if this algorithm falls, then the whole internet is in trouble!"

"Ok! Good enough for me!" Adira said, "So we'll make a backup everytime we work on the offline root CA. That way, if anything happens to the offline computer, we'll just have to setup another computer and restore the backup."

"I'll add that to our workflow then so that we don't forget" Leiko said.

"Perfect!" Jules said

That way, Hole-in-one avoided to be stuck during Jules spiritual retreats and survived the failing hard drive of the offline computer.

By the end of the fourth year, Adira went to Jules house.

"I am sorry Jules, I had no choice." Adira said.

"What happened Adira? What do you mean?" Jules asked.

"They came for me. I complied like we agreed but I still feel like a traitor." Adira said.

"You did what you had to do. Let's take care of you first." Jules said.

After starting the psychological help they needed for a few weeks, Adira explained how they were able to steal the offline root CA for Evil Corp.

"Since we need a quorum to access the offline root CA, I needed to get enough shares. So, last time I updated the operating system of the offline computer, I also setup a key logger. That's a simple program that records everything that is typed. Then I waited for us to access the root CA and reach a quorum. That same evening I got the file containing everything that was typed and thus all the shares that were used. I gave that and the backup to Evil Corp."

"That's... smart, Adira" Jules said, "again, don't be ashamed, you did the right thing."

While Jules was a bit ashamed that he had to use the Delorean again, he was proud of the team he assembled with Vernes and their creativity.
