O.R.CA is an Offline Root Certificate Authority.

The documentation is present in the `docs` folder as markdown files.

You can open it in webbrowser on your machine by running the following command:
```bash
mdbook watch --open
```

> [!Note]  
> The nix shell provided in the flake besides this readme automatically makes `mdbook` available to you

If you'd rather browse the documentation directly from the sources, your entry point will be [SUMMARY.md](./docs/SUMMARY.md)
